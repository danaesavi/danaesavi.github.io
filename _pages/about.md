I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Copenhagen working on multimodal models for NLP. I recently completed my Ph.D. in NLP at The University of Sheffield under the supervision of [Professor Nikos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/). Previously, I obtained an MSc in Computer Science from Sheffield University and a BSc in Computer Engineering from the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. I worked as a Research Associate in the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) at The University of Sheffield and as an Applied Scientist intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) with the Alexa Shopping Science team based in London. 

My research interests are in natural language processing, vision-and-language modeling, and computational social science. My [Ph.D. thesis](https://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/33952/) is particularly focused on introducing challenging tasks as well as novel methods to gain a better understanding of multimodal content and its underlying dynamics in the context of social media.

In my free time, I enjoy yoga and swimming.
