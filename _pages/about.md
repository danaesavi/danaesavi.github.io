I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Copenhagen working with the [LAMP](https://lampgroup.github.io/) group and affiliated with [CoAStaL NLP](https://coastalcph.github.io/) and the [Pioneer Center for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/). My current research focuses on model development, evaluation, and applications of vision-and-language models. I completed my Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing at the University of Sheffield (UK), supervised by [Professor Nikos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/), with research spanning computational social science, political communication, and multimodal modeling. I also hold an MSc in Computer Science from Sheffield and a BSc in Computer Engineering from ITAM (Mexico City). Previously, I worked as a Research Associate in the [SheffieldNLP](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) group and as an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon Alexa Shopping](https://www.amazon.science/), where I focused on generative language models.

My research interests lie at the intersection of NLP, vision-and-language modeling, and socially impactful AI. 

Outside of research, I enjoy yoga and pilates, and I‚Äôm passionate about mentoring students‚Äîespecially women from Latin America and other underrepresented communities in AI. I have co-organized LatinX in AI Workshop at NAACL'24 and I am part of the core team of [SomosNLP](https://somosnlp.org/) the Iberomerican NLP community.
