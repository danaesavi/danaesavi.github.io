I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Copenhagen](https://coastalcph.github.io/), working on large multimodal models for video and language understanding. My current research focuses on model development, evaluation, and real-world applications of vision-and-language systems. I completed my Ph.D. in Natural Language Processing at the University of Sheffield (UK), supervised by [Professor Nikos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/), with research spanning computational social science, political communication, and multimodal modeling. I also hold an MSc in Computer Science from Sheffield and a BSc in Computer Engineering from ITAM (Mexico City). Previously, I worked as a Research Associate in the [SheffieldNLP](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) group and as an Applied Scientist Intern at [Amazon Alexa Shopping](https://www.amazon.science/), where I focused on generative language models.

My research interests lie at the intersection of NLP, vision-and-language modeling, and socially impactful AI. 

Outside of research, I enjoy yoga and pilates, and Iâ€™m passionate about mentoring studentsâ€”especially from Latin America and other underrepresented communities in AI.
