I'm a PhD student in the [UKRI CDT in Speech and Language Technologies](https://slt-cdt.ac.uk) at University of Sheffield. My work is focused on multimodal analysis of social media under supervision of [Dr. Nikos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/). Previously, I earned an MSc in Computer Science from Sheffield University and a BSc from Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. I worked as an Applied Scientist intern at Amazon with the Alexa Shopping Science team based in London, UK. I also worked as a data scientist at [deep_dive](https://dive.ai/), a startup based in Mexico City dedicated to empower companies with data science.

My research interests are natural language processing and computational social science and my focus is on understanding the social and commercial aspects of language specifically from social media, as well as analyzing the relationship between text and image content of social media posts. 

In my free time I enjoy yoga and swimming.
