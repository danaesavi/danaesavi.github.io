I'm a PhD student in the [UKRI CDT in Speech and Language Technologies](https://slt-cdt.ac.uk) at University of Sheffield. My work is focused on multimodal analysis of social media under supervision of [Dr. Nikos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/). Previously, I earned an MSc in Computer Science from Sheffield University and a BSc from Instituto Tecnol√≥gico Aut√≥nomo de M√©xico. I also worked as a data scientist at [deep_dive](https://dive.ai/), a startup based in Mexico City dedicated to empower companies with data science.

My research interests are natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, and data science, and my field of study is multimodal computational social science. In my free time I enjoy yoga, ü•æ hiking, and üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è swimming.
