I'm a Ph.D. student in the [UKRI CDT in Speech and Language Technologies](https://slt-cdt.ac.uk) and a Research Associate in the [Natural Language Processing Group](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) at University of Sheffield. My work is focused on multimodal models for computational social science under the supervision of [Dr. Nikos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/). Previously, I obtained an MSc in Computer Science from Sheffield University and a BSc in Computer Engineering from the Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. I worked as an Applied Scientist intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) with the Alexa Shopping Science team based in London, UK. I also worked as a data scientist at [deep_dive](https://dive.ai/), a startup based in Mexico City dedicated to empowering companies with data science.

My research interests are in natural language processing, vision-and-language modeling, and computational social science. My Ph.D. has been particularly focused on introducing challenging tasks as well as novel methods to gain a better understanding of multimodal content and its underlying dynamics in the context of social media.

In my free time, I enjoy yoga and swimming.
