I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Copenhagen working on multimodal models for NLP. I recently completed my Ph.D. in NLP at The University of Sheffield under the supervision of [Professor Nikos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/). Previously, I obtained an MSc in Computer Science from Sheffield University and a BSc in Computer Engineering from the Instituto TecnolÃ³gico AutÃ³nomo de MÃ©xico. I worked as a Research Associate at [SheffieldNLP](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) group at The University of Sheffield and as an Applied Scientist intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) with the Alexa Shopping Science team based in London. 

My research interests are in natural language processing, vision-and-language modeling, and computational social science.

In my free time, I enjoy yoga and swimming.
