I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Copenhagen](https://coastalcph.github.io/) working on multimodal models for video understanding and NLP. I completed my Ph.D. in NLP at The University of Sheffield under the supervision of [Professor Nikos Aletras](http://nikosaletras.com/). Previously, I obtained an MSc in Computer Science from Sheffield University and a BSc in Computer Engineering from the Instituto TecnolÃ³gico AutÃ³nomo de MÃ©xico. I worked as a Research Associate at [SheffieldNLP](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/research/groups/natural-language-processing) group at The University of Sheffield and as an Applied Scientist intern at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) with the Alexa Shopping Science team based in London. 

My research interests are natural language processing, vision-and-language modeling, and computational social science.

In my free time, I enjoy yoga and pilates.

I am passionate about mentoring students, particularly those from Latin America, though Iâ€™m happy to help anyone. If youâ€™re a student seeking guidance on your CV, applications for MSc. or Ph.D. programs, or simply want to chat about the Ph.D. experience or related topics, feel free to reach out via emailâ€”Iâ€™d be glad to help!
