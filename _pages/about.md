I'm a PhD student in the [Speech and Language Technologies CDT](https://slt-cdt.ac.uk) at University of Sheffield. My work is focused on the intersection of NLP, Speech, and Vision. Previously, I was a student at University of Sheffield where I graduated with Distinction of the Advanced Computer Science Master's degree; and I completed my undergraduate's degree (BSc. Computer Engineering) at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México. I've gained industrial experience working as data scientist at deep_dive, a startup based in Mexico City dedicated to empower companies with data science.

My research interests are natural language processing, machine learning, and data science, and my field of study is multimodal computational social science. 

I believe technology is a powerful tool for building a better world.
