<mark> AACL 2023 </mark>  A Multimodal Analysis of Influencer Content on Twitter 
üèÜ Best Area Chair Award ‚Äì Society & NLP. *Danae S√°nchez Villegas, Catalina Goanta, Nikolaos Aletras*

We explore the challenges in automatically detecting regulatory compliance breaches in influencer advertising. We introduce a new dataset, and experiments to improve the detection of commercial influencer content.

We (1) introduce a new Twitter (now X) dataset of influencer posts mapped into commercial and non-commercial categories for assisting in the automatic detection of commercial influencer content; (2) experiment with an extensive set of predictive models that combine text and visual information showing that our proposed cross-attention approach outperforms state-ofthe-art multimodal models; and (3) conduct a thorough analysis of strengths and limitations of our models.
