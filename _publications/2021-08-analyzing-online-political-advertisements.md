**Abstract**

Online political advertising is a central aspect
of modern election campaigning for influencing public opinion. Computational analysis of
political ads is of utmost importance in political science to understand the characteristics
of digital campaigning. It is also important
in computational linguistics to study features
of political discourse and communication on
a large scale. In this work, we present the
first computational study on online political
ads with the aim to (1) infer the political ideology of an ad sponsor; and (2) identify whether
the sponsor is an official political party or a
third-party organization. We develop two new
large datasets for the two tasks consisting of
ads from the U.S.. Evaluation results show
that our approach that combines textual and visual information from pre-trained neural models outperforms a state-of-the-art method for
generic commercial ad classification. Finally,
we provide an in-depth analysis of the limitations of our best-performing models and linguistic analysis to study the characteristics of
political ads discourse.
