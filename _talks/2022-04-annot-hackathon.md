**Full day** of legal annotations on an Instagram influencer dataset for law&tech LLM students. 
Presented an introduction to machine learning and annotations, and organized an annotation task on an Instagram dataset of posts by mega and micro influencers.
This is a legal task that is becoming increasingly important for consumer and media authorities, but the scale of the creator economy is beyond their capabilities.
