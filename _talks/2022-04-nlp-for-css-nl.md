Large-scale analysis of the language people use in social media have applications in a variety of fields such as linguistics, political science, journalism, and geography. At the same time, language in social media presents challenges to the development of NLP models. In this talk, I will discuss recent work which attempts to overcome some of these challenges by jointly modeling related tasks or by combining relevant information such as visual content. We explore the task of automatically identifying political parody on social media and how we can combine parody with other relevant figurative devices such as humor and sarcasm. Finally, Iâ€™ll discuss work on integrating text and images for point-of-interest type prediction: studying the relationship between social media posts and the type of location from which it was posted (e.g. park, restaurant).
