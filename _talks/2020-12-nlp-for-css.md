Large-scale analysis of the language people use in social media have applications in a variety of fields such as linguistics, political science, journalism, and geography. In this talk, I concentrate on 3 studies (1) Political Parody: researching political parody as a figurative device in social media; (2) Political Ads: identifying the political ideology of the ad sponsor, and whether the ad sponsor was an official political party or a third-party organization; (3) Point-of-interest: studying the relationship between the text of social media and the type of location from which it was posted (e.g. park, restaurant).
