People express their opinions and experiences through text and images
in social media platforms. Large-scale analysis of the content that
people use in social media has diverse applications spanning
linguistics, geography, political science and advertising. Three
specific studies will be presented (1) Point-of-interest: studying the
relationship between the content of a post and the posting location
type (e.g. park, restaurant); (2) Political Ads: identifying the
political ideology of ad sponsors and distinguishing between official
political parties and third-party organizations; (3) Influencer
Content: examining influencer content, with a focus on multimodal
methods to detect monetized posts. [Slides](https://danaesavi.github.io/files/Copenhagen-Beyond%20Words_%20Analyzing%20Social%20Media%20with%20Text%20and%20Images.pdf)
